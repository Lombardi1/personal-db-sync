<!-- This is a placeholder for the binary content of an MP3 file.
     In a real scenario, this would be the actual binary data of the MP3.
     For demonstration purposes, I'm providing a comment.
     The user would typically upload their own MP3.
     
     Since I cannot directly embed binary data in this text-based response,
     I will create an empty MP3 file. The user can replace it with their desired audio.
     
     If you need a functional MP3, you would typically provide a URL or
     instruct the user to upload one. For now, this will create the file
     structure.
